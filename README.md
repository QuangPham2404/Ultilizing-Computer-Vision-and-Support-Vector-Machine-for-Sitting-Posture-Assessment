**I. Current situation on bad posture**
**1. In Vietnam**
Bad posture is a pressing issue among Vietnamese, especially in students. It is the main factor of scoliois, which the Commission for Information and Education reported to affect 1.3% to 36.33% of the students in major cities in Vietnam in 2022. This is an alarming rise from 7.4% in 2019, and the number is expected to continue to increase in the future.

**In the world**
Bad posture is also an urgent problem on the global scale. In the work place, poor posture causes musculoskeltal disorders such as carpal tunnel, back injury and back pain and also permanent damage to health, resulting in a great amount of expenses for treatments for both the employers and employee. One in every two americans is affected, and the cost per patient is 7800 in 2011, totaling in 796.3 billion dollars (Ding Z. et al., 2019). Due to the pandemic, the time people spent in sedentary activities such as sitting working on a computer for a long period has increased considerably. According to Vermander et al. (2024), nowadays people spend more than half of their daily hours in a seated position, reaching up to 85% of their hours in the case of people with low mobility.
